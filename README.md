# hi.health DevOps Engineer Assignment

Below is a take-home assignment before the technical interview for the position. This assignmennt requires an AWS account and is expected to be executable using only free-tier resources.

## Timing

- You will have one week from the time you receive the challenge to complete and return your work.
- Work life balance is important to us and for this reason we would like to ask that you do not work more than 4 hours on the project, preferably less.

## How this challenge will be judged
- First and foremost, your ability to develop a working solution using the tech stack specified in the rules
- Source control and work methodology is important so please use git, use meaningful commit messages and organize your work accordingly
- There is not one correct solution and so your solution will be unique. We will be paying attention to how you decide to solve the challenge, so please ensure that it reflects your strengths
- Explaining your thinking, decision points, and solution are critical. Comments and documentation will be reviewed and should provide context and clarity around your completed code.

## Delivery

- Please return your solution as a zip file or tarball of your git repo.

## Review
- After you deliver your work, one of our engineers will review your work
- Should you pass and move onto team interviews with our engineering team, there will likely be questions or discussions relating to this work, so please be prepared to help explain/teach your work!

## The task

Your task is to:
- Bootstrap a frontend and backend apps + database in ec2 using IaC (terraform or crossplane). The app is a very basic ordering system.
- The frontend should be accessible over the internet while the database and backend should not
- The backend app needs to connect to rds using IAM authentication
- A dockerfile is provided for the backend app, you will need to create one for the frontend
- Solve any issues that might arise with either the code or docker image
- Provide a script that automates the setup (We use a combination of bash, python and typescript internally. This are preferred but any language is accepted and it won't have an impact in the evaluation)
- Use your own git repo to perform this task, and provide a copy of it.

Optional tasks:
- Document exactly what else you'd add to best monitor the service. Even though this is a toy service, explain what sort of basic things you'd want to monitor as if it was a production service. (No need to implement an actual solution here.)
- If you were to implement this in kubernetes, describe how you would implement it and what you'd take into account when designing this.
- If you do use crossplane, please include bootstrapping a kind cluster and crossplane installation

## Last thoughts

- If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out.
